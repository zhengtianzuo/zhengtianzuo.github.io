# CSHARP

## introduction

CSharp is an object-oriented, user-oriented, and . A high-level programming language on top of the .NET Framework. It is scheduled to appear on the Microsoft Professional Developer Forum (PDC). CSharp is the latest work of Microsoft researcher Anders Hejlsberg. CSharp looks strikingly similar to Java; It includes things like single inheritance, interfaces, almost the same syntax as Java, and the process of compiling into intermediate code and running it. But CSharp is distinctly different from Java in that it borrows from Delphi in that it integrates directly with COM (Component Object Model) and is the protagonist of Microsoft's .NET windows web framework.
