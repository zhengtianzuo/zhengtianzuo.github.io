# Java

## introduction

Java is an object-oriented programming language that not only incorporates various advantages of C++ but also discards concepts such as complex multiple inheritance and pointers found in C++. As a result, the Java language possesses two key characteristics: powerful functionality and ease of use. Representing static object-oriented programming languages, Java effectively realizes object-oriented theory, allowing programmers to engage in complex programming with an elegant mindset. Java is characterized by simplicity, object orientation, distribution, robustness, security, platform independence and portability, multithreading, and dynamism. Java can be used to develop desktop applications, web applications, distributed systems, and embedded system applications.
