# CSHARP

## introduction

C# is an object-oriented, user-oriented, and . A high-level programming language on top of the .NET Framework. It is scheduled to appear on the Microsoft Professional Developer Forum (PDC). C# is the latest work of Microsoft researcher Anders Hejlsberg. C# looks strikingly similar to Java; It includes things like single inheritance, interfaces, almost the same syntax as Java, and the process of compiling into intermediate code and running it. But C# is distinctly different from Java in that it borrows from Delphi in that it integrates directly with COM (Component Object Model) and is the protagonist of Microsoft's .NET windows web framework.
