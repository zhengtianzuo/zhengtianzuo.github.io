# Go

## introduction

The Go language is a statically typed, compiled, and concurrent programming language developed by Google, featuring garbage collection. It critically assimilates the strengths of languages such as C and Java, embodying simplicity and efficiency to the fullest extent.

The Go language originated in 2007 when Google's technical experts were increasingly troubled by the growing bloat of C++. They resolved to develop a new language to replace C++. They believed that rather than continually adding new features to a bloated language, it would be better to simplify programming languages. Thus, the new language Golang was born.
