# Ruby

## introduction

Ruby, a scripting language created for simple and efficient object-oriented programming, was developed in the 1990s by Yukihiro Matsumoto in Japan, adhering to the GPL and Ruby License. Ruby is a programming language that is fully object-oriented with syntax similar to Smalltalk, script execution capabilities, and powerful text processing features akin to Perl. Its inspiration and characteristics are derived from Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp languages. The Ruby language itself has also led to the development of alternatives such as JRuby (for the Java platform) and IronRuby (for the .NET platform). Ruby began development on February 24, 1993, and was officially released to the public in December 1995 on fj (newsgroup). The name Ruby was chosen because the pronunciation of Perl is similar to that of the birthstone for June, pearl, while Ruby is named after the birthstone for July, ruby.
