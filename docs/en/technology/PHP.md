# PHP

## introduction

PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, Chinese: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a general-purpose open-source scripting language. The syntax absorbs the characteristics of C language, Java and Perl, which is easy to learn and widely used, mainly applicable to the field of web development. PHP's unique syntax is a mix of C, Java, Perl, and PHP's own syntax. It can execute dynamic web pages much faster than CGI or Perl. Compared with other programming languages, PHP embeds the program into HTML (an application under the standard Universal Markup Language) document to execute, which is much more efficient than CGI that fully generates HTML markup. PHP can also execute compiled code, which can be encrypted and optimized to run, making the code run faster.
