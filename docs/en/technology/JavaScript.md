# JavaScript

## introduction

JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that is widely used in web development, primarily to enhance the interactivity and dynamism of web pages. As one of the core technologies of web development, it collaborates with HTML and CSS, where HTML defines the content structure of web pages, CSS handles styling and layout, and JavaScript controls the behavior and interaction of web pages. Users can utilize JavaScript for various functions such as event handling, form validation, and animation creation. Furthermore, the application of JavaScript has expanded to server-side (such as Node.js), mobile application development, and game development, making it an indispensable part of modern programming environments. Its cross-platform and high adaptability characteristics have made JavaScript one of the most popular and widely used scripting languages globally.
