# C++

## introduction

C++ is an object-oriented computer programming language invented and implemented in the early 80s of the 20th century by Dr. Benjani Strausstrup of AT&T Bell Laboratories in the United States (originally this language was called "C with Classes"). It is a general-purpose programming language that supports multiple programming paradigms with static data type checking. It supports a variety of programming styles such as procedural programming, data abstraction, object-oriented programming, and generic programming. C++ is the inheritance of the C language, which further expands and improves the C language and becomes an object-oriented programming language. The word C++ is usually pronounced as "C plus plus" in Chinese mainland programmer circles, while Western programmers usually pronounce it as "C plus plus", "CPP".
