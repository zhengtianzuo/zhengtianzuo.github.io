# VisualBasic

## introduction

Visual Basic (abbreviated as VB) is a general-purpose object-based programming language developed by Microsoft, designed for structured, modular, object-oriented programming, featuring an event-driven mechanism with an integrated development environment. It is a language that can be used for the development of Microsoft's own products. "Visual" refers to the method of developing graphical user interfaces (GUIs) without the need to write extensive code to describe the appearance and position of interface elements, but rather by simply adding pre-established objects to a point on the screen. "Basic" refers to the BASIC (Beginners All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) language, which is one of the most widely used languages in the history of computing technology development. Visual Basic is derived from the BASIC programming language. VB features a graphical user interface (GUI) and a rapid application development (RAD) system, allowing for easy use of DAO, RDO, and ADO to connect to databases, or to effortlessly create ActiveX controls for efficiently generating type-safe and object-oriented applications. Programmers can quickly build an application using the components provided by VB.
