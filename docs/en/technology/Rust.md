# Rust

## introduction

Rust is a systems programming language that emphasizes high performance, reliability, and productivity, supporting various programming paradigms such as structured programming, functional programming, and object-oriented programming. 

Rust is a compiled language that does not have a runtime or garbage collector. It employs an ownership mechanism to achieve automatic memory management, thereby ensuring memory safety. Rust is an open-source project currently hosted on GitHub, and both Rust and all other official projects are dual-licensed under the Apache License 2.0 and the MIT License. The official package manager for Rust is Cargo.
