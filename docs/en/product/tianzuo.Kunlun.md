# introduction

**tianzuo.Kunlun** powerful local construction tools, provides all-round static detection, dynamic detection, code tools and various convenient plug-in tools for the project. Scan the program code through lexical analysis, syntax analysis, control flow, data flow analysis, memory detection, code coverage, hot function detection and other technologies to verify whether the code meets the standardization Safety, reliability, maintainability and other indicators. Deeply optimize the code according to the analysis results, improve the code quality and enhance the robustness of the product.

**legend:**
In the Kunlun Sky Palace in the Kunlun Mountain, the hometown of immortals, there is a legend that there is a god mirror, which has the power to travel freely through time and space. However, in a fairy pageant, the mirror was stolen by someone, and has been missing ever since.

# motivation
Build a local build tool that is easy to run and integrates various code inspections.

# features
- Workbench project indicators Collect various indicators of the project as part of the standard to measure the complexity of the project
- Workbench compilation run can compile projects manually or automatically
- Workbench Static detection scans the program code through lexical analysis, syntax analysis, control flow, data flow analysis and other technologies to check the consistency of code and design, code compliance with standards, readability, the correctness of the logical expression of the code, the rationality of the code structure and other aspects
- Workbench Dynamic detection By memory detection, code coverage, hot spot function detection and other technologies according to the analysis results of the code is deeply optimized. Improve code quality and product robustness
- Workbench Code tool automates code formatting and generates project documentation
- Toolkit covers all aspects of communication/graphics/design/conversion/generation/miscellaneous gadgets
- Data bag can record usually used code to the data bag, at any time to browse and copy
